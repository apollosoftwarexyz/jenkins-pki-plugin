    <p><b>Attribute Name</b></p>

    <p>This is an alias for the attribute that you can use when configuring attribute mappings.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Attributes are case-insensitive and will be normalized to uppercase.</b></li>
        <li>If there is a well-known value (such as <code>E</code> for email address), you should preferably use it.</li>
        <li>You should avoid using characters that require escaping, such as space, double quotes ("), ",", "+", "\", "<", ">" or ";".</li>
    </ul>
