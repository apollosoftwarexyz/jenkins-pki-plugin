<div>
    <p><b>Certificate Group Field</b></p>
    <p>The field of the X.500 subject that contains the user's group.</p>
    <p>Your X.509 infrastructure may not be set up in this way - or there may not be a group component that is as granular as you need (LDAP is likely a better fit for this property in large organizations). In these cases, you should leave this field blank.</p>
    <br />

    <p><b>For example:</b></p>
    <p>If your subject looked like "<code>UID=jsmith,CN=John Smith,OU=people,O=My Organization,C=GB</code>"; you could supply <code>OU</code> as the "Group Field" to get "people" as the group.</p>
